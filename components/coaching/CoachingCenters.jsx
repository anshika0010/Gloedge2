        university, they must prove their proficiency in English language
        skills.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Most universities across the world require applicants to provide proof
        of their proficiency in the English language. This is often mandatory
        for their admission to courses in these universities. Students going
        abroad for higher studies are advised to take these tests at least two
        months before applying to universities abroad. They can take any one of
        the following tests and submit their scores with their applications to
        prove their English language proficiency:

        skills. The tests measure a student’s verbal ability and quantitative
        reasoning skills. Students should be well prepared before taking these
