        Y-Axis Eligibility Evaluation
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        When you plan to migrate abroad to work, invest, or settle, you must
        first determine whether you can apply for a visa to enter that nation.
        This can help you evaluate whether applying for a visa to migrate to a
        given nation is worth your time and effort. This is where determining
        eligibility is crucial.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Each country has its own set of eligibility criteria. Countries such as
        Australia, Canada, Saskatchewan, Quebec, the United Kingdom, and Germany
        use a points-based system to determine whether applicants are eligible
        to live, work, or study in their country.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Your eligibility depends on factors like your educational
        qualifications, work experience, language proficiency, number of points
        obtained and the condition for earning them by each country.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-6">
        Eligibility evaluation is a process that determines whether or not you
        might be able to apply for a specific visa for a particular country.
        Regarding migration, countries like Canada, Australia, and the United
        Kingdom require points-based eligibility evaluation.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-6">
        You must obtain an eligibility evaluation before filling out the
        application form for these nations. This will assist you in determining
        whether you satisfy the requirements and can move ahead with the
        process. As a result, you’ll be able to only prepare and not dragging
        the visa.
