          Australia Significant Investor Visa
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          This visa was introduced in 2012. With this visa, High-Net-Worth
          Individuals (HNWIs) can get a PR Visa to Australia through investment
          immigration. Applicants must be nominated by an Australian state/territory or by Austrade to qualify for this visa. Although significant in HNWI, it is regulated and strictly monitored.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Commonly referred to as the Golden Visa, the Significant Investor Visa
          for Australia offers a streamlined immigration pathway to
          High-Net-Worth Individuals (HNWIs) through investment.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Path to permanent residency</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Investors who acquire Australia residency by investment will get—along
          with their spouse and children—citizenship after a few years by
          converting the visa through the Investment & Business Innovation
          program. This is the most sought-after option for HNWIs looking for
          global mobility.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          For this visa, an applicant must meet financial conditions, can apply
          for PR after 4 years, and must show that they have a long-term
          commercial interest by registering their investment and filing local
          tax returns.
